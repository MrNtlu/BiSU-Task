## Important Notes
* There is a delay on the [News Api Request](https://github.com/MrNtlu/BiSU-Task/blob/5e3b6ebc62485e9e14597c3102aee881240626f4/app/src/main/java/com/mrntlu/bisu/models/NewsPagingSource.kt#L29) to show "Login Screen" longer and better.

* I've used the Jetpack Compose for News Detail Screen. [Composable File](https://github.com/MrNtlu/BiSU-Task/blob/5e3b6ebc62485e9e14597c3102aee881240626f4/app/src/main/java/com/mrntlu/bisu/ui/composeable/NewsDetail.kt)

* For some reason on the latest version of the Android Emulator, Firebase doesn't work, it cannot connect to the servers. I had to downgrade to version [31.2.9](https://developer.android.com/studio/emulator_archive). I also tested on Physical device and there wasn't any issue. If you encounter any problems please let me know.
